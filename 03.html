            <p>Musical composition, or simply composition, can refer to an original piece or work of music,
            either vocal or instrumental, the structure of a musical piece, or to the process of creating or writing a new piece of music
            People who create new compositions are called composers. Composers of primarily songs are usually called songwriters;
            with songs, the person who writes lyrics for a song is the lyricist. In many cultures, including Western classical music,
            the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music "score," which is then performed
            by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve
            the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.
            In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play
            the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by
            the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.
            In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song
            in their mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings
            by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. </p>
