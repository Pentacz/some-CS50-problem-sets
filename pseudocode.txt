// Program stores the value written when running caesar (run with one command-line argument)
// the value is stored as integer i - iterate to make sure all characters are digits
// program gets string from user
// each character's place in array is being substracted by 'i' value 
// if it's an uppercase letter, rotate it
// if it is a lowercase letter, shift it
// if none, print as it is
// print a newline
