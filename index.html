            <h2>This page will be probably about jazz</h2>

            <div class="child">
                <p>By Wikipedia <q>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans,
                United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. <br>
                Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music".</q></p>
                <p>This site will be rather about <b>contemporary</b> jazz being created in recent years. <br>
                Current generation of cross genre jazz groups are reaching a wide spectrum of audiences,
                in the Jazz world as well as in other genres. They take full pots from
                rock, classical music, middle eastern folk music, and of course, older jazz bands.</p>
                <p>
                    To the most interesting parts which <em>we love in music most</em> one can count:
                    <ul>
                     <li>Composition</li>
                     <li>Pitch <i>(which governs melody and harmony)</i></li>
                     <li>Meter</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p><u>IMHO</u> <strong>unusual meter is the best!</strong></p>
