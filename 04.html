            <p>Pitch is a perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering on a frequency-related scale, or more commonly,
            pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies.
            Pitch can be determined only in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise.
            Pitch is a major auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre.</p>

            <p>Pitch may be quantified as a frequency, but pitch is not a purely objective physical property;
            it is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound. Historically, the study of pitch and pitch perception
            has been a central problem in psychoacoustics, and has been instrumental in forming and testing theories of sound
            representation, processing, and perception in the auditory system. </p>
            <p>sorry for just a definition, I lack motivation to go full enthusiastic about it:)</p>
