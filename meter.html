        <h1>Meters in music!</h1>

        <div class="child">
        <h3>In music, metre (Am. meter) refers to the regularly recurring patterns and accents such as bars and beats.
        Unlike rhythm, metric onsets are not necessarily sounded, but are nevertheless expected by the listener. </h3>
        <p>If that doesn't tells you anything, you can imagine meter is like line (verse) in a poetry, which has always some
        patterns like 8-syllable count. The same is in music.</p>
        <p>But standard meter counts are boring, here are some examples that are particularly unintuitive</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_czmAJ3A3T4">Avishai Cohen - One for Mark</a> - piece actually composed
        for current for that time drummer of the trio, who is known to use a lot of strange metrics.<br>
        In this song you can watch changing meter:
        <ul>
            <li>first loop 3x5 (or 8+4 or 8 - which ever is easier for you to count)</li>
            <li>since 1 min 30 sec it's changing to "classic" 7/8</li>
            <li>and since 2:35 to 10/8, just to make it more unintuitive performers are changing accents.</li></p>

        </ul>
        <p><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpiMFBDxrlU>GoGo Penguin - Reactor</a> - in this one we can observe
        3 x 7/8 + one bar of 6/8.</p>
